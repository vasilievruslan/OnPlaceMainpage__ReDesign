			<p>Tokenization of the process of investing into shares of private companies has a number of serious advantages in comparison to the approaches existing in the market today:</p>
			<ul class="parameters__list">
				<li class="parameters__item">The threshold for investors is essentially cut from tens of thousands of dollars to a 	dollar available to any beginning investor.</li>
				<li class="parameters__item">Transaction expenses are lowered by 50 times.</li>
				<li class="parameters__item">The usage of digital tokens allows one to 	overcome difficulties of inputs and withdrawals from deals, ensuring high liquidity which has only been available through the usage of tools located on exchanges.</li>

				<div>A typical tokenized asset created and managed within the specifications of PATS protocol holds an opportunity to go through 4 major stages, due to the direct specifics and nature of the underlying asset itself. </div>
				<div>Using PATS functionality allows to input digital tokenized assets into circulation that, according to the timeframe attribute on the roadmap, will circulate within the following 3 major stages, essentially being the significant events in the development of the company’s business that is backed by its shares. </div>
				<div>High liquidity of the tokens (observed daily) is achieved due to their circulation on an exchange, while within the PATS protocol the token holders are able to trade them for liquid cryptocurrencies as significant major events come up – the next qualified round of financing, one of the last stage rounds of financing, during which most holders decide to withdraw an asset, or directly at the time of the company’s IPO. </div>
